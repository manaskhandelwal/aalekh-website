# Aalekh

### What is Aalekh?

Sanskrit for ‘writing’, AALKEH is Bennett University’s annual literary fest that aims to showcase ‘the Power of Ink’. The two-day bilingual fest’s essence and spirit is to promote reading, writing, and learning with publishing support.
It was envisioned to usher in, at the start of every new year, the goodness of books, the values they carry within and the worldliness they leave the readers with.

A joint endeavour proposed by Bennett University’s Learning Resource Centre and CEREBRUM – the official Literary and Debating Society at Bennett University, AALEKH recognizes and celebrates the might of the pen through a ‘Carnival of Books’.
